        <h3 class="text-secondary font-semibold">Job and His Family in Uz</h3>
        <p class="text-pretty">
          <span class="float-left text-4xl text-secondary font-bold me-1">1</span>
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">1</span>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name <em>was</em> Job; and that man was blameless and upright, and one who feared God and shunned evil.
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">2</span>And seven sons and three daughters were born to him.
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">3</span>Also, his possessions were seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred female donkeys, and a very large household, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the East.
        </p>

        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">4</span>And his sons would go and feast <em>in their</em> houses, each on his <em>appointed</em> day, and would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">5</span>So it was, when the days of feasting had run their course, that Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings <em>according to</em> the number of them all. For Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts." Thus Job did regularly.
        </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4 text-secondary font-semibold">Satan Attacks Job's Character</h3>
        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">6</span>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the <Lord />, and Satan also came among them.
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">7</span>And the <Lord /> said to Satan, "From where do you come?"
        </p>
        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          So Satan answered the <Lord /> and said, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking back and forth on it."
        </p>
        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">8</span>Then the <Lord /> said to Satan, "Have you considered My servant Job, that <em>there is</em> none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, one who fears God and shuns evil?"
        </p>
        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">9</span>So Satan answered the <Lord /> and said, "Does Job fear God for nothing?
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">10</span>Have You not made a hedge around him, around his household, and around all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">11</span>But now, stretch out Your hand and touch all that he has, and he will surely curse You to Your face!"
        </p>
        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">12</span>And the <Lord /> said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has <em>is</em> in your power; only do not lay a hand on his <em>person</em>."
        </p>
        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          So Satan went out from the presence of the <Lord />.

          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">13</span>Now there was a day when his sons and daughters <em>were</em> eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house;

        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">20</span>Then Job arose, tore his robe, and shaved his head; and he fell to the ground and worshiped.
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">21</span>And he said:
