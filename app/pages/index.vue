          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">1</span>After these things the word of the <Lord /> came to Abram in a vision, saying, "Do not be afraid, Abram. I <em>am</em> your shield, your exceedingly great reward."

        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">2</span>But Abram said, "Lord <God />, what will You give me, seeing I go childless, and the heir of my house <em>is</em> Eliezer of Damascus?"
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">3</span>Then Abram said, "Look, You have given me no offspring; indeed one born in my house is my heir!"

        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">4</span>And behold, the word of the <Lord /> <em>came</em> to him, saying, "This one shall not be your heir, but one who will come from your own body shall be your heir."
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">5</span>Then He brought him outside and said, "Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them." And He said to him, "So shall your descendants be."
        </p>

        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">6</span>And he believed in the <Lord />, and He accounted it to him for righteousness.

        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">7</span>Then He said to him, "I <em>am</em> the <Lord />, who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land to inherit it."
        </p>

        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">8</span>And he said, "Lord <God />, how shall I know that I will inherit it?"

        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">9</span>So He said to him, "Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">10</span>Then he brought all these to Him and cut them in two, down the middle, and placed each piece opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds in two.
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">11</span>And when the vultures came down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away.

        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">12</span>Now when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram; and behold, horror <em>and</em> great darkness fell upon him.
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">13</span>Then He said to Abram: "Know certainly that your descendants will be strangers in a land <em>that is</em> not theirs, and will serve them, and they will afflict them four hundred years.
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">14</span>And also the nation whom they serve I will judge; afterward they shall come out with great possessions.
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">15</span>Now as for you, you shall go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried at a good old age.
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">16</span>But in the fourth generation they shall return here, for the iniquity of the Amorites <em>is</em> not yet complete."

        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">17</span>And it came to pass, when the sun went down and it was dark, that behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a burning torch that passed between those pieces.
          <span class="text-xs font-extralight align-text-top me-0.5">18</span>On the same day the <Lord /> made a covenant with Abram, saying:
        </p>

        <p class="indent-6 text-pretty">
          "To your descendants I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to the great river, the River <span class="whitespace-nowrap">Euphrates&mdash;</span>
